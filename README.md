# suno-archiver-m4a

This is a fork that adds a --m4a option to download the **M4A** audio files, that are also used by the Web UI to hear the tracks.
WAV is also integrated from the [original suno-archiver](https://github.com/closestfriend/suno-archiver) (thanks @GuyPaddock for the fix), but wav costs download credits.
MP3 do not work currently as far as I tested.

# suno-archiver

Archive your entire Suno music library — audio, cover art, and full metadata — with one command.

## Why

Suno's web UI only lets you download tracks one at a time. If you've generated more than a handful, pulling them all by hand is tedious-to-impossible. This tool can grab your **entire** library or the **given workspaces** in one command — audio, cover art, and full metadata as JSON — organized on your own disk.

Useful if you:

- have a large library (hundreds or thousands of generations) and want it all local — for a DAW, a dataset, offline access, or your own bookkeeping. A 1,600-track pull is one run, not 1,600 clicks.
- want your data in a structured, scriptable form — every track's prompt, tags, model, and timestamps in JSON, plus a single `library_index.json` you can grep or query.
- don't want to depend on the cloud staying put. Suno's Warner Music deal (early 2026) pulled free download access ahead of schedule; terms can change again. A local copy doesn't.

Run it on a schedule with `--last-run` and the archive stays current automatically.

It archives **every workspace**, not just your unassigned clips — see the warning below if you used version 1.x.

## Status: maintained, honestly labeled

This tool rides Suno's **private studio API** (`studio-api.prod.suno.com`) and authenticates by reusing your browser's Clerk session cookie. Suno publishes no stable API: **any backend change on their side can break this tool without notice.** That is a property of the territory, not a bug to fix.

- **Core flow (MP3 + cover art + metadata): verified end-to-end 2026-08-08** on a Pro account — browser-session detection, Clerk token exchange, workspace enumeration, a live archive run, idempotent re-runs, and `--last-run` incremental sync. User reports through late September 2026 confirm auth, workspace enumeration, and MP3 downloads still working.
- **`--wav` is broken upstream** since ~August 2026 — Suno's convert endpoint now returns HTTP 204 ([#2](https://github.com/closestfriend/suno-archiver/issues/2)). MP3s are unaffected.
- **Encrypted M4A downloads are out of scope.** Suno serves M4A encrypted; decrypting their delivery is circumvention, and this project won't ship it ([#4](https://github.com/closestfriend/suno-archiver/issues/4)).

Maintenance mode: I keep the core MP3 archive path working as long as that stays cheap, and label breakage here when it isn't. Archive your library while the ground is firm.

> ⚠️ **If you used version 1.x, your archive is incomplete.** Every release through 1.0.1 fetched only Suno's `default` project — which is just the *unassigned clips* bucket — so anything you filed into a named workspace was silently skipped, with the run still reporting `0 errors`. On the 4,257-clip library this was measured against, 1.0.1 retrieved 1,768 and missed **2,489 tracks (58%)**. Upgrade with `pip install -U suno-archiver` and re-run. Fixed in 2.0.0, which also changes the archive layout — see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

> **Tested at scale.** A **1,668-track** single run — **5.7 GB**, 99.9% success rate, no rate-limiting or throttling. The handful of missing files were dead/transient links on Suno's CDN, not failures of the tool — and a re-run picks them up. Workspace enumeration is verified against a **4,257-clip library spanning 19 workspaces** and two years (2024–2026).

## What it grabs

| File | Details |
|---|---|
| `library_index.json` | All songs in one file, grep/jq-friendly |
| `.json` | Full metadata — prompt, tags, lyrics, duration, model version, created/updated dates |
| `.jpg` | Cover art linekd in the json |
| `--m4a` | Audio (Suno's M4A stream) linked in the json (free, as it is the stream you hear, when playing) |
| `--wav` | Optional: triggers Suno's lossless conversion and downloads the WAV alongside the MP3 (slower — one conversion request per song, costs a download credit) |

## Important

- **Personal backup of your own creations only.** Do not scrape other users' libraries (I think it does not work anyways).
- **Plan requirements (partly unverified):** confirmed working end-to-end on a **Pro** plan. Metadata and cover art don't depend on your plan. Free-tier **audio** is untested — Suno removed the web-UI *download button* for free accounts after the 2026 Warner deal, but this tool pulls audio straight from the library API's CDN URLs rather than using that button, so it may still work on free. If you try it on a free plan, a report (issue/PR) is welcome.
- **Undocumented API** — Suno can change or break this at any time. Run `suno-archiver doctor` if something stops working, and check for updates with `pip install -U suno-archiver`.

## Install

```bash
pipx install suno-archiver   # recommended: isolated environment
# or
pip install suno-archiver
```

Requires Python 3.9+.

## Auth

### Primary: just be logged in to suno.com in your browser

That's it. `suno-archiver` uses [rookiepy](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/rookiepy) to read your existing browser session cookie automatically. Works with Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Safari, Arc, Edge, and more — no manual steps needed.

```bash
suno-archiver        # rookiepy finds your session automatically
```

### Fallback: set SUNO_COOKIE manually

Use this if browser auto-detection fails (headless servers, CI, multiple profiles, or just for troubleshooting):

1. Open [suno.com](https://suno.com) in Chrome and make sure you're logged in.
2. Open DevTools → Network tab → reload the page.
3. Click any request to `clerk.suno.com` (look for `client?__clerk_api_version=...`).
4. Select the **Cookies** tab in the request detail panel.
5. Find the `__client` cookie — it's a long three-segment JWT (looks like `eyJ...`).
6. Copy its value.

```bash
# .env file or shell environment
SUNO_COOKIE=eyJhbGci...   # paste the full __client value here
```

Then run `suno-archiver doctor` to confirm it's working.

## Usage

```bash
suno-archiver                      # full archive: MP3s + covers + metadata
suno-archiver --wav                # also WAVs (slower: conversion per song)
suno-archiver --no-art             # skip cover art (audio + metadata only)
suno-archiver --last-run           # only what's new since the last run
suno-archiver --since "2 weeks ago"
suno-archiver --dir ~/Music/suno_archive
suno-archiver workspaces           # list your workspaces and clip counts
suno-archiver --workspace BEATS    # only that workspace (repeatable, -w)
suno-archiver doctor               # diagnose auth/API issues
```

### Working with one workspace

`--workspace` is the practical way to use `--wav`: a whole-library WAV pull is one
conversion request per song and enormous on disk, but a single workspace is very
manageable.

```bash
suno-archiver workspaces                      # see what you have
suno-archiver --workspace BEATS --wav         # lossless, just that workspace
```

Names are matched case-insensitively, against either the Suno name or the on-disk
folder name (`HOUSE/SYNTHPOP/RETRO` or `HOUSE_SYNTHPOP_RETRO` both work). An
unrecognized name is an error that lists the available workspaces — it will never
quietly archive nothing. Use `_unassigned` for clips you never filed anywhere.

A workspace-filtered run deliberately does **not** advance the `--last-run`
watermark: that watermark is global, so moving it after archiving a subset would
make your next incremental sync skip older clips in every workspace you didn't
select.

Re-runs are **idempotent** — existing files are skipped, so `--last-run` on a cron job keeps your archive current without re-downloading anything.

## What lands on disk

```
suno_archive/
├── BEATS/                                               (a Suno workspace)
│   └── 2026-06/
│       ├── 2026-06-02_concrete-syncope_49291ca0.mp3
│       ├── 2026-06-02_concrete-syncope_49291ca0.jpg     (cover art)
│       └── 2026-06-02_concrete-syncope_49291ca0.json    (full metadata)
├── HOUSE_SYNTHPOP_RETRO/                                (slashes flattened to _)
│   └── 2026-05/
├── _unassigned/                                         (Suno's default project)
│   └── 2026-06/
├── library_index.json    (everything, searchable with jq/grep)
└── .suno-archiver-state.json
```

Songs are organized by **workspace**, then into `YYYY-MM/` month folders. Clips you never filed anywhere land in `_unassigned/`. Workspace names are reduced to a single safe path segment, so `HOUSE/SYNTHPOP/RETRO` becomes one folder rather than three nested ones.

Each clip's JSON carries a `workspace` field, and `library_index.json` includes a per-workspace count summary:

```bash
jq '.workspaces' suno_archive/library_index.json
jq '.clips[] | select(.workspace=="BEATS") | .title' suno_archive/library_index.json
```

The state file records the last run timestamp for `--last-run` incremental syncs.

## Resilient by design

Archiving thousands of files over an undocumented API means things will occasionally go wrong mid-run. The tool is built so that they don't cost you:

- **Per-file errors never abort the run.** A dead CDN link (403) or a transient hiccup (503) is counted and reported, then the run continues. You get a clear tally at the end: `3333 downloaded, 0 skipped, 3 errors`.
- **Expired sessions self-heal.** Suno's auth tokens are short-lived; the tool transparently re-mints them, and retries once on a 401 before giving up.
- **Interrupted runs are safe.** The `--last-run` watermark is only saved when a fetch completes cleanly — so a connection drop or a kill mid-run can never cause the *next* incremental sync to silently skip tracks. You just re-run.
- **Re-runs are free.** Idempotent skipping means re-running after a partial failure costs nothing for already-downloaded files; only the gaps are retried.

If the tool ever stops working entirely (Suno changed their API), `suno-archiver doctor` tells you *which* layer broke — your login, the auth exchange, or the library endpoint — so you know whether to re-log-in or wait for an update.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/closestfriend/suno-archiver
